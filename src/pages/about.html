                <p>I am a software developer with over 3 years of experience in all scopes of the software. I have built multiple apps from front to back, including hosting all the infrastructure that comes with it. I also have a solid understanding of AI which I developed in my early career whilst working for Rolls-Royce.</p>
                <p>I built my own online crypto-betting exchange on the blockchain in 2022 and helped build and maintain the UKâ€™s main healthcare application and booking system.</p>
                <p>My specialty is a holistic knowledge of all areas of software and a great understanding of best practices to set any software project up for a bright and prosperous future.</p>
